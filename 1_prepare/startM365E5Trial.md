# Start Microsoft 365 E5 Trial

A Microsoft 365 E5 license can only be added to an existing Azure tenant. Therefore, it is important to first get an Office 365 E5 subscription to create an Azure tenant. For this demonstration, trial licenses will be used in both instances.

## Main Steps
1. Sign up for an Office 365 E5 Trial License.
2. Activate a Microsoft 365 E5 Trial License.
3. Update your User’s License from Office 365 E5 Trial to Microsoft 365 E5 Trial.

## Sign up for an Office 365 E5 Trial License
1. Browse to [Microsoft 365: Office 365 E5 Product Portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e5) and select `Free trial`.

9. Once you are done with the initial steps, clicking on either	`Get Started` or `Manage your subscription` leads you to a login page. Login with your username and password specified in Step 7.

10. If you had clicked on `Manage your subscription`, you would enter your [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). Under `Billing`, you can verify your current `Products` and see the new Office 365 E5 Trial license there. You can validate that your trial has started and ends in 30 days.

If you check your current `Domains` under `Settings`, you will see your new domain which was created earlier in Step 6. (Click `Show all` if you do not see `Settings`)

11. If you had clicked on `Get Started`, you would have the option to continue setting up a few things such as a custom domain or new users to your organization. However, that’s something we are going to do in other documents. Click `Exit setup` (at the bottom of the page) to leave these setup steps for later.
