# Start Microsoft 365 E5 Trial

A Microsoft 365 E5 license can only be added to an existing Azure tenant. Therefore, it is important to first get an Office 365 E5 subscription to create an Azure tenant.

## Main Steps
* Sign up for an Office 365 E5 Trial License
* Active Microsoft 365 E5 Trial 
* Update your User’s License from Office 365 to Microsoft 365 E5 Trial

9. Once you are done with the initial steps, one option is to click on `Manage your subscription` to go to your [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). There you can verify you current `Products` and see the new Office 365 E5 Trial license there. You can validate that your trial has started and ends in 30 days.

10. Another option would be to click on `Get Started` and continue setting up a few things such as a custom domain or new users to your organization. However, that’s something we are going to do in other documents. Just Exit out of that setup step.

If you check your current domains under `Settings`, you will see your new one.
