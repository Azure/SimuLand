    "# Read Mail Messages via MS Graph APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "A threat actor with the right permissions and credentials can access and collect confidential information of interest right away. One example would be the collection of e-mails. An adversary can use Azure AD registered applications with `Mail.Read` or `Mail.ReadWrite` permissions to collect e-mails from a signed-in user mailbox or all mailboxes. This would depend on the type of permission (Delegated or Role) granted to the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we are going to access the mailbox of a user via an application with `Mail.ReadWrite` delegated permissions.\n",
